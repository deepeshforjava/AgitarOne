Steps to Generate the Test Cases with Agitor

1. Register on Agitor website with official id for 30 days trial period.
2. Download the Agitor with the provided id and password in the email.
3. Unzip the downloaded software in C:\ or any directory.
4. Open command prompt and Go to C:\agitorOne\bin and then startup.cmd
5. This will open a new console for server running which should not be closed.
6. Verify the server with http://localhost:8080/agitar-server/ in browser. 
7. From this console url, you can see the Dashboard, running Jobs, reports etc.
